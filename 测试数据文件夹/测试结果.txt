1.
语法树如下:
  Read: x
  If
    Op: <
      Const: 0
      Id: x
    Assign to: fact
      Const: 1
    Repeat
      Assign to: fact
        Op: *
          Id: fact
          Id: x
      Assign to: x
        Op: -
          Id: x
          Const: 1
      Op: =
        Id: x
        Const: 0
    Write
      Id: fact

2.
语法树如下:
  Read: n
  Assign to: n
    Op: ^
      Id: n
      Op: ^
        Const: 2
        Op: ^
          Const: 3
          Op: ^
            Const: 4
            Const: 5
  Write
    Id: n

3.
语法树如下:
  Read: x
  Assign to: sum
    Const: 0
  Assign to: i
    Const: 1
  Unknown ExpNode kind
    Op: <=
      Id: i
      Id: x
    Assign to: sum
      Op: +
        Id: sum
        Id: i
    Assign to: i
      Op: +
        Id: i
        Const: 1
  Write
    Id: sum

4.
  For: i (increment)
    Const: 1
    Const: 5
    Read: x
    Write
      Id: x
